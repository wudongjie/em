## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the spelling mistake in the description.

* Added the "--compact-vignettes=both" argument for R CMD build.

* Fixed acronyms in the description and added references.

* Changed T or F to TRUE or FALSE

* ADD \value to .Rd files

* add "on.exit()" to "plot.em.R"

* restrict the default number of cores to 2 cores.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs, one NOTE (New submission). 

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
