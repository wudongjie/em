Description: A generic function for running the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
  within a maximum likelihood framework, based on Dempster, Laird, and Rubin (1977) <doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1977.tb01600.x>
  is implemented. It can be applied after a model fitting using R's existing functions and packages. The research leading to the software described here has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement no. 851293).
